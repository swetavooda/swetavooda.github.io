## LangCache Semantic Caching Library for LLM Queries
*`Python` | Database - Query optimization | Cache | `OpenAI`*

November 2023
* Created LangCache, a semantic caching library to boost LLM query efficiency. Integrated with OpenAI GPT-3.5, improved workflow by **query optimization** and implemented advanced storage solutions, achieving higher cache-hit rates and **improved performance by 30%**.

## MapReduce Framework Development 
*`C++` | `gRPC`*

December 2023
* Implemented the `MapReduce` framework inspired by the original paper for processing large text files using `gRPC` in `C++`. Optimized performance through file sharding and asynchronous completion queues, ensuring dynamic workload distribution and resource efficiency.

## Implementation of Barrier Synchronization algorithms using OpenMP and MPI 
*`OpenMP` | `MPI` | `C` | `Slurm`*

October 2023

* Developed and implemented advanced barrier synchronization algorithms using `OpenMP` and `MPI` in `C`, drawing inspiration from
*Mellor-Crummey and Scott's research*. Conducted comprehensive experiments on the PACE COC ICE Cluster, analyzing algorithm behavior and performance in-depth.

## Dynamic Resource Management for Virtual Machines 
*`libvirt` | `C` | CPU and Memory Virtualization*

September 2023

* Developed a **vCPU scheduler and memory coordinator** as part of a project, leveraging C programming and the `libvirt` toolkit to
dynamically manage resources for guest virtual machines, including *hypervisor calls* for **load balancing, memory ballooning**, and efficient resource allocation, while ensuring optimal performance and stability.

## Mini-Internet Network Connectivity Project 
*`BGP` | `OSPF` | `IXP` | `RPKI`*

September 2023

* Designed and operated a mini-Internet, collaborating with over 100 classmates to establish end-to-end connectivity across 70
*Autonomous Systems (ASes)* using routing and switching technologies, including `OSPF` and `BGP`, while implementing **BGP policies** and **security** measures based on business relationships and `RPKI` to mitigate **BGP hijacks**.

## Open-source contribution, MetaBrainz organization 
*`Python` | Database Design*

February 2020 – May 2020

* Submitted a design proposal for a backend database system to ensure multi-version compatibility of the application. This design
was crucial for enhancing data acquisition, which in turn improved predictive capabilities in a machine learning model (v2 data).

## Drishti – Automated Attendance using facial recognition 
*`SQLite` | `Python`*

September 2019
* Designed and developed backend database and system for the machine learning model to generate dashboards of the attendance.
