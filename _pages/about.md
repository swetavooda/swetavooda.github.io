🚀 Engaged in research with [Prof. Joy Arulraj](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/) at the [Georgia Tech Database Group](https://db.cc.gatech.edu/), developing PostgreSQL extensions and RAGs(Retrieval-augmented generation) for ML and AI applications.

📝 Curious about bridging the performance of vector databases like Pinecone with the simplicity of PostgreSQL? I shared my journey building exactly that in this Medium article: [**🚀 pgvector-remote: A pgvector fork with the performance of Pinecone**](https://medium.com/@sweta.vooda/pgvector-remote-a-pgvector-fork-with-the-performance-of-pinecone-5d8a7f6a50bd)

🤝 Committed to boosting system efficiency and encouraging teamwork through innovative problem-solving.
