## ðŸš€ pgvector-remote: A pgvector fork with the performance of Pinecone  
**Published on Medium**  
[Read it here](https://medium.com/@sweta.vooda/pgvector-remote-a-pgvector-fork-with-the-performance-of-pinecone-5d8a7f6a50bd)

**pgvector-remote** is a PostgreSQL extension designed to effortlessly incorporate remote vector stores, like **Pinecone**, into `pgvector`.  
It introduces a new *remote vector index type*, combining the simplicity of pgvector with the power and speed of external vector databases.

This project is part of my research with the [Georgia Tech Database Group](https://db.cc.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Joy Arulraj](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/)
