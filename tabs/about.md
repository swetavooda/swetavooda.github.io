Hello there! Thank you for visiting my site and taking a moment to read my blog.

I am Sweta Vooda a 2nd-year undergrad at Keshav Memorial Institute of Technology majoring in Information Technology.
I am passionate about new technologies, new ideas and new ways of thinking.

I am interested in competitive programming, web development, Data Science, Deep Learning, Database models and management systems.

Some of my other interests include Singing, Dancing and Painting.

(I try to sing mostly any kind of songs but might sound the best in classical tone. However, I mostly spend time admiring all kinds of music), Dancing ( A Kuchipudi dancer but can come along and try dancing on any songs ;p) and painting sceneries.

Sometimes I also try to write for my college e-magazine. You can check out a few of my articles [here](https://kmit.in/emagazine/author/sweta-vooda/){:target="_blank"}.
